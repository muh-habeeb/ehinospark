# Upload Error Fix Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

1. **Sharp Compatibility Fix**
   - Made Sharp import dynamic and optional
   - Added fallback to upload without optimization if Sharp fails
   - Added environment variable `DISABLE_SHARP` to disable Sharp if needed

2. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Enhanced error handling in upload components
   - Added proper JSON response validation
   - Better error messages for debugging

3. **Route Configuration**
   - Added GET handler to prevent 405 errors
   - Improved error logging and response format

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your production environment:
```bash
IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT=your_url_endpoint

# Optional: If Sharp causes issues
DISABLE_SHARP=false
```

### 2. Deploy the Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix upload errors: Sharp compatibility and error handling"
git push origin main
```

### 3. If Sharp Still Causes Issues
Set this environment variable in production:
```bash
DISABLE_SHARP=true
```

### 4. Test Endpoints
After deployment, test these endpoints:

1. **Health Check:**
   ```
   GET https://your-domain.com/api/health
   ```

2. **Upload Debug:**
   ```
   POST https://your-domain.com/api/upload-debug
   (with a test image file)
   ```

3. **Regular Upload:**
   ```
   POST https://your-domain.com/api/upload
   (with a test image file)
   ```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If you still get 405 errors:
- Check that the route file is properly deployed
- Verify the API endpoint URL is correct
- Check server logs for any deployment issues

### If Sharp errors persist:
1. Set `DISABLE_SHARP=true` in environment variables
2. Redeploy the application
3. Sharp optimization will be skipped but uploads will work

### If uploads still fail:
1. Check ImageKit credentials and quotas
2. Verify network connectivity to ImageKit
3. Check file size limits on your hosting platform
4. Use the debug endpoint to get detailed error information

## üìä Monitoring

Monitor these metrics after deployment:
- Upload success rate
- Error logs for Sharp-related issues
- ImageKit API usage and quotas
- Server response times for upload endpoints
